## Daily & Weekly Maintenance

### Regular Vacuuming
- **Frequency**: Vacuum weekly for normal traffic, 2-3 times weekly for high-traffic areas
- **Technique**: Use suction-only mode without beater bars or rotating brushes
- **Direction**: Vacuum in the direction of the fiber grain, then against it
- **Special attention**: Focus on edges and corners where dirt accumulates
- **Handheld option**: For delicate areas, use a handheld vacuum with upholstery attachment

### Quick Cleaning Routine
- **Daily**: Shake out small rugs outdoors to remove surface dust
- **Weekly**: Use a soft-bristled brush to gently remove embedded dirt
- **Spot checks**: Inspect for stains, loose fibers, or wear patterns
- **Air circulation**: Ensure good airflow around and under the rug

## Stain Removal & Spot Cleaning

### Immediate Response Protocol
1. **Act quickly** - Address spills within minutes to prevent permanent staining
2. **Blot, don't rub** - Use clean, white cloths to absorb liquid from outside in
3. **Remove solids** - Scrape away solid matter with a spoon or dull knife
4. **Test first** - Always test cleaning solutions in an inconspicuous area

### Natural Cleaning Solutions

#### For General Stains
- **Mild solution**: Mix 1 tsp white vinegar + 1 tsp liquid dish soap + 1 cup warm water
- **Application**: Spray lightly, blot with clean cloth, rinse with damp cloth
- **Drying**: Pat dry immediately and allow to air dry completely

#### For Specific Stains

**Food & Beverage Stains**:
- **Coffee/Tea**: Cold water rinse, then vinegar solution
- **Wine**: Salt absorption immediately, then cold water and vinegar solution
- **Oil-based**: Sprinkle cornstarch, let sit 15 minutes, vacuum, then treat with dish soap solution

**Organic Stains**:
- **Pet accidents**: Enzyme-based cleaner specifically for natural fibers
- **Mud**: Let dry completely, vacuum, then treat remaining stain with soap solution
- **Blood**: Cold water only, never hot water which sets the protein

**Wax & Gum**:
- **Method**: Freeze with ice cubes, scrape gently, treat residue with vinegar solution

### What to Avoid
- **Harsh chemicals**: Bleach, strong detergents, or chemical stain removers
- **Excessive water**: Over-wetting can cause shrinkage and weakening of natural fibers
- **Heat treatment**: Never use hot water or heat guns on natural fiber rugs
- **Rubbing**: Aggressive scrubbing damages fiber structure

---

## Environmental Considerations

### Sunlight Protection
- **UV damage**: Rotate rugs monthly to prevent uneven fading
- **Window treatments**: Use UV-filtering blinds or curtains in sunny rooms
- **Indoor lighting**: LED lights produce less heat and UV than incandescent bulbs
- **Protective coating**: Ask about UV-resistant treatments for outdoor use

### Humidity & Moisture Control
- **Optimal range**: Maintain 30-50% relative humidity
- **Dehumidifiers**: Use in basements or naturally humid environments
- **Air circulation**: Ensure proper ventilation in enclosed spaces
- **Seasonal adjustments**: Monitor humidity changes during weather transitions

### Temperature Stability
- **Consistent conditions**: Avoid placing rugs near heating/cooling vents
- **Floor heating**: Ensure compatibility with underfloor heating systems
- **Storage temperature**: Keep stored rugs in climate-controlled environments

---

## Professional Cleaning

### When to Call Professionals
- **Annual deep cleaning** for high-traffic areas
- **Stubborn stains** that home remedies can't remove
- **Water damage** from flooding or major spills
- **Odor issues** that persist after home treatment
- **Valuable rugs** requiring specialized care

### Choosing the Right Service
- **Natural fiber experience**: Verify expertise with jute, sisal, and other natural materials
- **Cleaning methods**: Ensure they use gentle, fiber-appropriate techniques
- **Drying process**: Confirm proper drying facilities to prevent mold/mildew
- **Insurance**: Check that they carry insurance for valuable items

### Professional Cleaning Process
1. **Pre-inspection**: Assessment of fiber type, construction, and damage
2. **Pre-treatment**: Gentle spot treatment of stains
3. **Cleaning**: Appropriate method (dry cleaning, low-moisture, or specialized natural fiber cleaning)
4. **Drying**: Controlled environment drying to prevent shrinkage
5. **Final inspection**: Quality check and fiber protection application if needed

## Proper Storage

### Short-term Storage (1-6 months)
- **Clean thoroughly** before storage to prevent pest attraction
- **Complete drying** - ensure no moisture remains
- **Rolling method**: Roll rugs face-side in around an acid-free tube
- **Wrapping**: Use breathable cotton sheets or muslin, never plastic
- **Position**: Store horizontally if possible, vertically if space is limited

### Long-term Storage (6+ months)
- **Climate control**: Cool, dry space with stable temperature (60-70Â°F)
- **Pest prevention**: Cedar blocks or lavender sachets (natural deterrents)
- **Regular checks**: Inspect every 3-6 months for pest damage or moisture
- **Air circulation**: Unwrap and re-roll annually to prevent permanent creases
- **Documentation**: Photo damage before storage for insurance purposes

### Storage Mistakes to Avoid
- **Plastic wrapping**: Traps moisture leading to mold and mildew
- **Folding**: Creates permanent creases in natural fibers
- **Basement/attic storage**: Extreme temperature and humidity fluctuations
- **Direct floor contact**: Use pallets or shelving to prevent moisture wicking
- **Mothballs**: Chemical treatments can damage natural fibers

## Extending Rug Lifespan

### Strategic Placement
- **High-traffic areas**: Choose appropriate fiber types (sisal for durability)
- **Entryways**: Use entrance mats to reduce soil tracking
- **Under furniture**: Distribute weight with furniture pads
- **Stairs**: Secure properly to prevent slipping and uneven wear

### Rotation Schedule
- **Monthly**: Turn rugs 180 degrees to distribute wear patterns
- **Seasonal**: Move rugs to different rooms if possible
- **Furniture rearrangement**: Coordinate with room layouts for even traffic distribution

### Protective Measures
- **Rug pads**: Use breathable, natural rubber pads to prevent slipping
- **Furniture protection**: Felt pads under all furniture legs
- **Pet considerations**: Regular nail trimming, potty training reinforcement
- **Shoe policies**: Consider shoes-off policies in rug areas

### Shedding
- **Normal process**: New natural fiber rugs shed initially
- **Duration**: Typically reduces after 3-6 months of regular vacuuming
